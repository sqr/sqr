### Hi there 👋

After a decade in media leadership, I carved my own path in engineering by solving business needs through software. With a background in JavaScript, Python and React, I bring over a year of hands-on expertise in optimizing AWS infrastructures and refining CI/CD workflows.

I have a 12 year old Beagle named Croquetita 🐶
